# Lua-Command-Line-Animation
This is a File that allows to make animations in the command line.

## How to us?
Add the the files to your project folder. Now to custmize the animation you can open up the ``animation.lua``. The first variable is a table(or list) of frames. Each line is what each frame will be. You can add more by adding a comment at the end and write th next frame in quotation marks like this ``"Test"``. The next variable is the amount of frames you have. **Note:** If you get the frame count wrong the program will break or end short. The last variable is the amount of time in between each frame. Once you finish with creating your animation. Run the ``execute.lua`` file. Enjoy.
