# Lua-Command-Line-Animation
This is a File that allows to make animations in the command line.

## How to us?
First you need to download the file and place it the project folder. Once there you need to make a ``animation.lua`` file

--this is where you put your frames
frame = { 
    ">----\n",
    "=>---\n",
    "==>--\n",
    "===>-\n",
    "====>\n",
    "=====\n"
}

--This is the amount of frames
frame.frames = 6

--The seconds between each frame 
sec = 0.1 

Then paste this code in. You can add more frames by adding a comment and making another line.
